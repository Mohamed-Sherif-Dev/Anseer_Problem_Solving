📌 Problem Solving Repository (JavaScript)

📖 Overview

This repository is dedicated to problem solving practice using JavaScript.
It contains a wide collection of algorithmic problems solved step by step, focusing on understanding, correctness, and clean logic, not just passing tests.

Each problem is implemented in its own file to keep solutions organized, readable, and easy to revisit.

⸻

🎯 Goals of This Repository
	•	Strengthen algorithmic thinking
	•	Practice solving problems without shortcuts (e.g. avoiding eval where forbidden)
	•	Cover multiple problem-solving patterns
	•	Build a solid reference for revision and interviews

⸻

🧠 Covered Topics

This repository includes problems from different categories, such as:
	•	✅ Math & Arithmetic
	•	✅ Strings
	•	✅ Arrays
	•	✅ Two Pointers
	•	✅ Sliding Window
	•	✅ Binary Search
	•	✅ Recursion
	•	✅ Parsing & Expression Evaluation
	•	✅ Edge Case Handling
	•	⏳ (More to be added: Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, etc.)

⸻

📂 Project Structure

Each problem has its own file, for example:
problem-solving/
│
├── stringEvaluator.js
├── twoSum.js
├── isPalindrome.js
├── maxProfit.js
├── slidingWindowMax.js
├── binarySearch.js
└── ...This structure makes it easy to:
	•	Review a specific problem
	•	Add new problems without affecting others
	•	Track progress over time

⸻

⚙️ Technologies Used
	•	JavaScript (ES6+)
	•	Node.js (for local testing)
	•	Online judges like Codewars for validation

⸻

🚀 How to Use
	1.	Clone the repository
	2.	Open any problem file
	3.	Read the problem description (in comments if available)
	4.	Review or run the solution
	5.	Modify or optimize as practice

⸻

📌 Notes
	•	All solutions prioritize clarity over clever tricks
	•	Edge cases are handled explicitly
	•	No unsafe methods (eval, etc.) are used when forbidden

⸻

📈 Progress

This repository is continuously updated as more problems are solved and new patterns are learned.
